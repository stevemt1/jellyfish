Jellyfish

A 2D game where the player is set in an underground cave where they play as a jellyfish. The goal of the game is to find the baby jellyfish in the cave that are lost. Although the cave is dark, the player has the ability to light up to make the dark more bearable. By collecting light objects, the player can keep lighting up the way to find their babies. The player must also avoid enemies to avoid dying.

controls:
	- arrow keys for movement
	- space bar to “light up”
	- ‘R’ for restart

bugs:
	- enemies become “unseen” sometimes because of rotation problems, but 	adds more suspense???

mechanics:
	- movement
	- player health, damaging enemies
	- enemy ai that chases player if they are close enough; different 	enemies with different speeds/damage
	- light up ability that allows player to see more of the screen
	- goal items to pick up that avoid the larger Enemy
